# CHIP-8-Emulator
This is just a small little project for me to learn emulation in my spare time, as it's fairly lightweight and can run on just about anything.

I've still been working on KinectToVR, it's just that this one is a little easier (read: actually possible) to run on my laptop away from home.

# DIY
I found documentation and accompaning resources to help make the project here:
http://www.codeslinger.co.uk/pages/projects/chip8.html
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8

# Building the Project
Don't download the zip file directly from Github, as last time I tested, it doesn't properly grab the submodules, which are needed to compile the project.

1. Pull the project from git: git clone --recurse-submodules http://github.com/sharkyh20/CHIP-8-Emulator/
1. Compile the Native File Dialog solution in both Debug and Release
1.
